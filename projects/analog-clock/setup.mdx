Final output will look like this

## Prerequisite

Basic knowledge of

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setup

1. Create a separate folder named `clock` and open it using your favorite code editor. I love VS Code.
2. After that, create three files inside the `analog-clock` folder named `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`.

<!-- ![Files](/img/projects/analog-clock/files.png) -->

Now you are ready to build the clock... Go to the next chapter!
