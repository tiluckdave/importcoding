## Getting started

When we talk about flat design, you might think about the creepy palette and some old-fashioned web trends, but no, flat design is a wide term and in this case for FlatifyCSS, there are some principles that shape it clearly you will understand it easily.

## Download

FlatifyCSS is available for users in many ways, you can install it using package managers, directly from CDN, or even downloading [lastest project archive](https://github.com/amir2mi/flatifycss/archive/master.zip).

### CDN

Here is [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), you can add FlatifyCSS just with a single line of code:

### CSS

CSS files come with some options, files with `-noprefix` suffix, do not have [PostCSS Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), while `-min` means this file is minified and `-rtl` is the special file for languages like Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, etc which direction is right to left.

`flatify.css`  
`flatify-min.css`  
`flatify-noprefix.css`  
`flatify-noprefix-min.css`

`flatify-rtl-min.css`  
`flatify-rtl-noprefix.css`  
`flatify-rtl-noprefix-min.css`

### JS

Note that FlatifyCSS needs [Popperjs](https://popper.js.org/) for dropdowns and popovers, but this library is not included inside the JavaScript file of FlatifyCSS, so it is up to you to include it inside your webpage.

`flatify.js`  
`flatify-min.js`
