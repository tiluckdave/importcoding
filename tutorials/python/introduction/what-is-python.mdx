# Python Introduction

## What is Python

**Python** is a **high-level, dynamic, general-purpose** interpreted programming language. It supports an object-oriented programming approach to developing applications. It is simple and easy to learn and provides many high-level data structures.

Python is an easy to learn but powerful and flexible scripting language which makes it attractive for application development.

Python's dynamic syntax and typing coupled with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for rapid application development and scripting.

Python supports multiple programming patterns, including objectoriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.

## Python History

Python was invented by **Guido van Rossum** in 1991 at CWI in Netherland. The idea of Python programming language has taken from the ABC programming language or we can say that ABC is a predecessor of Python language.

There is also a fact behind the choosing name Python. Guido van Rossum was a fan of the popular BBC comedy show of that time, **"Monty Python's Flying Circus".** So he decided to pick the name Python for his newly created programming language.

Python has the vast community across the world and releases its version within the short period.
